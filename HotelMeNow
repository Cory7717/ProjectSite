  <h2>Hotel Tips:  Know before you go!</h2>
    <p class id="p2"><em>Travel tip #1:</em>  Know the types of services the hotel provides based on their "Star Rating".  Very few things are more frustrtaing for travelers and hotel employees than guests arriving with expectations that aren't provided by the hotel.  For example: If you are looking for a good complimentary breakfast, research which hotels offer that as an option before booking. If you book a stay at a full service Holiday Inn, expect for the breakfast to be better quality but will not be complimentary.  You would be better suited staying at a Holiday Inn Express than a full service Holiday Inn.
